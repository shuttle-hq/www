# Shuttle Launchpad #2: Structs and Enums

Welcome to the second issue of *Shuttle Launchpad*. We learned about how to get started with Cargo and Rust in the first issue, now we're working through our first real web application! The focus of today's issue: Structs and Enums!

**Is this your first issue of _Launchpad_?**, check out the [Archive](https://www.shuttle.dev/launchpad/issues/2023-06-16-issue-01-Getting-Started) on www.shuttle.dev.

## A Podcast Application.

We want to create a podcast website. The root gives an overview of a list of episodes, the episode page shows the title, description, and a link to the audio file.

To get the necessary podcast information, we use the RSS feed from your favorite podcast show!

We will deploy the application on Shuttle. This issue assumes that you brushed up your skills on Cargo from issue 1, where we also installed the Shuttle CLI tools using `cargo install cargo-shuttle`.

Let's create a new project.

```bash
$ mkdir podcast-app
$ cd podcast-app
$ cargo shuttle init
```

Make sure to select `axum` and pick a nice name for your app! Next, add a few dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
reqwest = "0.11.18"
xml = "0.8.10"
anyhow = "1.0.71"
```

In this issue, we want to learn how to define structs and enums. We will use them to parse the XML feed from the podcast. Structs are compound data types that can hold multiple values of different types. Enums are types that can have a fixed set of values, called variants.

To represent our podcast items, we define a new struct called `Podcast` with three fields: `title`, `description`, and `audio_file`. The `audio_file` is optional, while the RSS feed requires `title` and `description`, the audio file might not always be available, which is pretty bad for a podcast, isn't it? We use the `Option` type to represent this.

The `Option` type is an enum with two variants: `Some` and `None`. The `Some` variant wraps a value, while `None` represents the absence of a value. With that type, Rust effectively avoids having `null` or `undefined` values. It also requires you to explicitly check for each variant, which is a good thing, because it forces you to think about the absence of a value.

```rust
struct Podcast {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    audio_file: Option<String>,
}
```

In Rust, you can attach methods to structs. We use this to define a constructor for our `Podcast` struct. The `new` method returns a new instance of `Podcast` with empty fields. The audio file is not set, this is why we set it to `None`.

The `Self` type refers to the type of the current struct. In our case, `Self` is `Podcast`.

```rust
impl Podcast {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            title: String::new(),
            description: String::new(),
            audio_file: None,
        }
    }
}
```

Alright! Podcast feeds are RSS feeds, which means they exist as XML files. Hello? 1990s Java has called and wants to have their beloved file format back! Anyway, we define a function called `read_podcasts_from_xml` that takes a URL and returns a vector of `Podcast` items. The `async` keyword indicates that this function is asynchronous. We will learn more about asynchronous programming in a later issue.

We also need to import the `Result` type from the `anyhow` crate. The `Result` type is an enum that works very similarly to `Option`. It indicates the successful execution of a function or an error. We will learn more about `Result` and what it does in a later issue.

```rust
use anyhow::Result;

async fn read_podcasts_from_xml(url: &str) -> Result<Vec<Podcast>> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    // more code here!
    Ok(results)
}
```

Add the following lines to the `read_podcats_from_xml` function. We use the `reqwest` crate to download the feed from the given URL. The `reqwest` crate is an HTTP client for Rust. The `await` keyword indicates that we work in an asynchronous context. The `?` operator gets the value from the `Result` type or returns early if the `Result` is an error. Again, more on that in a later issue. With this line, we get the XML data as a string.

We also create a new `EventReader` from the `xml` crate. The `EventReader` is a parser for XML files. It takes a `BufReader` as input, which we create from the XML data. The `BufReader` is a buffered reader that reads the XML data in chunks. This is more efficient than reading the whole file at once.

```rust
use xml::EventReader;
use std::io::BufReader;

let data = reqwest::get(url).await?.text().await?;
let parser = EventReader::new(BufReader::new(data.as_bytes()));
```

Reading XMLs is a bit cumbersome. The XML parsing library also works with enums and tells us if we are inside an opening tag, closing tag, or within the contents of an item.

```xml
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Podcast name</title>
    <link>https://podcast.com</link>
    <item>
      <title>
         <![CDATA[ ...]]>
      </title>
      <description>
       <![CDATA[ ...]]>
      </description>
      <enclosure url="podcast.mp3" length="56525065" type="audio/mpeg"/>
    </item>
    ...
  </channel>
</rss>
```

We can extract the information we need from the XML by iterating over each item and reading the contents of `title`, `description`, and the `url` property of `enclosure`. Since the XML Parser has a different set of states, we create our own enum to keep track of the current state of the parser. We call it `ParseState` and define three variants: `Start`, `InTitle`, and `InDescription`.

```rust
enum ParseState {
    Start,
    InTitle,
    InDescription,
}
```

We use a variable called `state` to keep track of the current state of the parser. We start with `ParseState::Start`, which indicates that we are at the beginning of the file. We also create a new `Podcast` instance.

```rust
let mut podcast = Podcast::new();
let mut state = ParseState::Start;
```

We loop over each event that the parser returns. The `match` keyword allows us to match the current event against a set of patterns. If the pattern matches, we execute the code in the corresponding branch.

If the `Result` is `Ok`, we match against the `XmlEvent::StartElement` variant. This variant indicates that we are inside an opening tag.

In the case of `title` and `description`, we set our own `state` variable to `ParseState::InTitle` and `ParseState::InDescription`. This allows us to keep track of the current state of the parser, so we can assign the contents (defined via the `CData` variants) to the correct field of the `Podcast` struct.

In the case of `enclosure`, we go through all its attributes and look for the `url` attribute. If we find it, we set the `audio_file` field of the `Podcast` struct to the value of the `url` attribute.

When we find a closing `item` tag, we add the parsed podcast episode to our vector, reset the `state` variable, and create a new `Podcast` instance.

```rust
use xml::reader::XmlEvent;

for event in parser {
    match event {
        Ok(XmlEvent::StartElement {
            name, attributes, ..
        }) => match name.local_name.as_str() {
            "title" => state = ParseState::InTitle,
            "description" => state = ParseState::InDescription,
            "enclosure" => {
                podcast.audio_file = attributes.into_iter().find_map(|attr| {
                    if attr.name.local_name == "url" {
                        Some(attr.value)
                    } else {
                        None
                    }
                });
            }
            _ => {}
        },
        Ok(XmlEvent::CData(content)) => match state {
            ParseState::InTitle => {
                podcast.title = content;
                state = ParseState::Start;
            }
            ParseState::InDescription => {
                podcast.description = content;
                state = ParseState::Start;
            }
            _ => {}
        },
        Ok(XmlEvent::EndElement { name }) => {
            if name.local_name == "item" {
                results.push(podcast);
                podcast = Podcast::new();
                state = ParseState::Start;
            }
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

Note that all enum variants from `XmlEvent` contain data, this can be either a struct or a simple fiel (like in the case of `CData`). Enums not only indicate state, but they can carry associated data, making it easier for us get the right thing at the right time.

The `..` syntax in the `Ok(XmlEvent::StartElement { name, attributes, .. })` pattern is called a _rest pattern_. It allows us to ignore the rest of the fields in the struct. In this case, we are only interested in the `name` and `attributes` fields.

Fantastic, we successfully parsed an RSS feed and extracted the relevant information. Now it's time for the actual web application.

Rewrite the `axum` function and make sure you load the podcasts into a `podcasts` variable. We use the `Arc` type to share the podcasts between different executions of the same callback because they happen across threads.

We also define two routes, one for the root path `/` and one for every podcast episode. The `root` callback returns a list of all podcasts, while the `podcast` callback returns the HTML for a single podcast episode.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use axum::{routing::get, Router};

type AppState = Arc<Vec<Podcast>>;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let podcasts =
         read_podcasts_from_xml("https://url-to-your-favourite-podcast").await?;
    let app_state = Arc::new(podcasts);
    let router = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(root))
        .route("/:id", get(podcast))
        .with_state(app_state);

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

To display a single podcast, we need to create a string representation, containing the HTML with the title, description, and audio file. We can do this by implementing a `to_html` method on the `Podcast` struct.

We use the `format!` macro to create a string representation of the HTML. It's similar to `println!`, except that it returns a string instead of putting out the result to the command line. The `r#` syntax allows us to create a raw string, which means we don't have to escape the double quotes. We can use the `{}` syntax to interpolate the values of the `title` and `description` fields.

What you also see is the `&self` parameter. This is a reference to the current instance of the struct. We will talk about references in a future issue, but for now, all you need to know is that you can access the fields of the struct via `self.[field_name]`.

```rust
impl Podcast {
    // ...
    fn to_html(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            r#"
            My Podcast: {}
            Title: {}
            Description: {}
            Audio: {}
        "#,
            self.title,
            self.title,
            self.description,
            match self.audio_file {
                Some(ref file) => file,
                None => "No audio available",
            }
        )
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: The newsletter screws up with the HTML representation, get the real code on [Github](https://gist.github.com/ddprrt/f46956f76e056e358a3ab29af511f6c0)

Notice that the `audio_file` might either exist or it doesn't. Rust requires us to handle every variant. We _need_ to make sure that we handle the `None` case, otherwise, the compiler will complain.

Now that we can create string representations for `Podcast`, we implement the `podcast` handler. We add two extractors, one for the state and one for the path. The state extractor allows us to access the `Arc<Vec<Podcast>>` that we defined earlier. The path extractor allows us to access the `id` parameter from the path.

```rust
use axum::{extract::{State, Path}, response::{IntoResponse, Html}};

async fn podcast(
    State(app_state): State<AppState>, Path(id): Path<usize>
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let podcast = app_state.get(id);
    Html(match podcast {
        Some(podcast) => podcast.to_html(),
        None => "No podcast found".to_string(),
    })
}
```

One beautiful thing about Axum extractors is that we don't need to make sure that the `id` is an actual number. By specifying the correct type in the handler function, Axum will only execute the handler if the `id` is a number. If it isn't, it will return an error! This is one of the things that I just _love_ about Rust!

---

_💡 Note for experienced developers_: Not happy that I use `new` for an empty struct and `to_html` for an HTML representation? You are absolutely right! This is a challenge for you, make this code more idiomatic and closer to what we usually see in Rust. A few tips:

- Use the `Default` trait instead of `new`
- Implement `IntoResponse` for `Podcast` instead of having its own method.

---

The `root` handler is a bit more complex. We need to iterate over all podcasts and create a list of links. We can do this by using the `iter` method on the `Arc<Vec<Podcast>>` and then using `enumerate` to get the index of each podcast. We then map each podcast to a string representation of a link. Finally, we join all links with a newline character.

```rust
async fn root(
    State(app_state): State<AppState>
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let response = format!(
        r#"
List of podcasts
{}
    "#,
        app_state
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .map(|(id, podcast)| {
                format!(r#"- /{}: {}"#, id, podcast.title)
            })
            .collect::<Vec<String>>()
            .join("\n")
    );
    Html(response)
}
```

And that's about it! Now with all the code in place, we can run the application and see if it works.

```bash
$ cargo shuttle run
```

You should see something like this:

![Screenshot of the web application root](https://www.shuttle.dev/images/launchpad/1/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot of the web application podcast](https://www.shuttle.dev/images/launchpad/1/screenshot2.png)

```bash
$ cargo shuttle deploy
```

And that's it! You just deployed a podcast web application to the cloud! 🎉

Let us quickly reiterate what we have learned:

- Structs are used to group related data together.
- Enums are used to define a type that can have multiple variants. Each variant can have different data associated with it.
-  Both can have `impl` blocks, which allow us to define methods on the struct or enum.
- `Option` is an enum that can either be `Some` or `None`. It is used to represent the absence of a value.

Btw. the app looks a little bleak, give it some beautiful styles! You can find the examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddprrt/shuttle-launchpad-examples).
