            ‚ÄúI came into the first Batch with very little Rust expereience,
            having read most of the Rust book I was looking to get involved in
            Open Source to better my knowledge.

            The relaxed but supportive vibe in Batch was the perfect way for me
            to get to know the language better, to mix with people at a similar
            skill level, and to get quality guidence from the more experienced
            guys at Shuttle.‚Äù
