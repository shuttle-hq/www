          And while there are plenty of resources out there, they can often be
          overwhelming, difficult to follow, or simply not engaging enough to
          hold your attention.

          The Rust Book and various YouTube videos, for example, are
          comprehensive but can leave you feeling lost in the details, while
          other tutorials may not provide enough context or real-world examples
          to make the concepts stick, especially with the rapid developments of
          the Rust ecosystem.
