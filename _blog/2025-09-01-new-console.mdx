### Introduction - The New Shuttle Console

We've just shipped a brand new Shuttle Console. The goal was clear: make it easier to discover features, smoother to manage projects of any size, and reflective of Shuttle's productionâ€‘ready quality. This update is about clarity, speed, and scale â€” all while staying true to our Infrastructure from Code approach.

### Why the Console Matters

At Shuttle, our philosophy has always been simple: deploying applications should be simple. Infrastructure requirements and code don't need to be separate and that's what makes Shuttle different â€” your application is defined, deployed, and scaled using our Infrastructure from Code (IfC) framework.

But while your infra requirements live in code, the console is where you see what's running. It's where you check deployments, understand resources, and discover what else Shuttle can do for you. The console is the window into Shuttle's capabilities.

The new console is our biggest step yet in making that window clearer, faster, and more representative of what Shuttle is: the simplest place to deploy production applications

### Why We Changed It - Listening and Learning

The old console worked, but it wasn't keeping up with the platform. Features like resources, configurable instance sizes, or collaboration were often hidden away. Workflows weren't always consistent. And for some of our Growth users â€” managing 30+ projects on Shuttle â€” the console just didn't scale.

You told us what you needed:

- Better feature discoverability.
- More consistent design and workflows.
- A console that matched Shuttle's reliability under the hood.

This redesign is our response.

### What We Changed - Feature Highlights

Here's what you'll notice right away:

- **Project Overview Page**: All essential features in one place. Quick actions, including stop and deploy, and a clean structure make it easy to find and use the features you need.
- **Deployments Page**: Git commit ID and message and full-screen logs, and clear guidance for troubleshooting. When something breaks, you know where to look.
- **Domain Setup**: Clear flow with copy-paste CNAME instructions and validation states.
- **Secret management**: Direct secret management from Console
- **Configurable compute size:** Pre-filled compute tier configuration that you can copy directly into your project for easy instance size adjustments.
- **Design Language**: A standardised, consistent design system across all pages, making every workflow feel predictable and smooth.

### Key Product Decisions - Staying True to Infrastructure as Code

One of the biggest questions we asked ourselves was: *what should the console do, and what should stay in code?*

We kept our opinionated approach: the console shows you what's running and teaches you how to use IfC annotations in your project code. That's why you'll see things like pre-filled config snippets instead of dropdown menus. The goal isn't to replace code, but to help you discover and apply Shuttle's features in the right way.

By staying true to infra-as-code, the console becomes more than a dashboard â€” it's a guide to using Shuttle the way it's meant to be used.

### What This Means for You

- **Faster**: Features are easier to discover, workflows are clearer.
- **Scalable**: Whether you're running one project or thirty, the console helps you manage at any level.
- **Production-ready**: A design that reflects the maturity of the platform you're running on.
- **Empowering**: A console that doesn't just show you state, but teaches you how to get more out of Shuttle.

### Check It Out

The new console is live today. Log in to your account (or create one if you're new) and see what's changed.

We built this console with you â€” your feedback, your workflows, your needs. Now we'd love to hear what you think.
