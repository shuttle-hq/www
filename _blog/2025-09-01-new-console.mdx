## Introduction - The New Shuttle Console

We've just shipped a brand new Shuttle Console. As our user base grew and platform matured we knew it was time for a *major* upgrade. The goal was clear: make it easier to discover features, smoother to manage projects of any size, and reflective of Shuttle's production-ready quality. This update is about simplicity, ease, and scale.

## Why the Console Matters

At Shuttle, our philosophy has always been simple: deploying applications should be straightforward. Infrastructure requirements and code don't need to be separate; your application should be defined, deployed, and scaled without unnecessary complexity.

But while your infra requirements live in code, the console is where you see what's running. It's where you check deployments, understand resources, and discover what else Shuttle can do for you. The console is a window into Shuttle's capabilities.

The new console is our biggest step yet in making that window clearer, faster, and more representative of what Shuttle is: the simplest place to deploy production applications.

## Why We Changed It - Listening and Learning

The old console worked, but it wasn't keeping up with the platform. Features like resources, configurable instance sizes, or collaboration were often hidden away. Workflows weren't always consistent. And for some of our Growth users managing many projects on Shuttle, the console just didn't scale.

You told us what you needed:

- Better feature discoverability.
- More consistent design and workflows.
- A console that matched Shuttle's reliability under the hood.

This redesign is our response.

## What We Changed - Feature Highlights

Here's what you'll notice right away:

- **Project Overview Page**: All essential features in one place. Quick actions, including stop and deploy, and a clean structure make it easy to find and use the features you need.
- **Deployments Page**: Git commit ID and message. as well as full-screen logs
- **Domain Setup**: Clear flow with copy-paste CNAME instructions and validation states.
- **Secret Management**: Manage secrets directly from the console.
- **Configurable Compute Size**: Copy pre-filled compute tier configuration directly into your project for easy instance size adjustments.
- **Design Language**: A standardised, consistent design system across all pages, making every workflow feel predictable and smooth.

## Key Product Decisions - Staying True to Developers

One of the biggest questions we asked ourselves was: *what should the console do, and what should stay in code?*

We kept our opinionated approach: the console shows you what's running and guides you toward the right workflows. That's why you'll see things like pre-filled config snippets instead of dropdown menus. The goal isn't to replace code, but to help you discover and apply Shuttle's features in the right way.

By making these conscious choices, the console becomes more than a dashboard; it's a guide to using Shuttle the way it's meant to be used.

## What This Means for You

- **Faster**: Features are easier to discover, workflows are clearer.
- **Scalable**: Whether you're running one project or thirty, the console helps you manage at any level.
- **Production-ready**: A design that reflects the maturity of the platform you're running on.
- **Empowering**: A console that doesn't just show you state, but teaches you how to get more out of Shuttle.
