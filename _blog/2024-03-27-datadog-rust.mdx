## Some words about observability

As we all know, being able to '*see*' what's going on in our services can be critical in many ways. We can easily find bugs or identify undesired behaviors, and it's certainly an invaluable tool at our disposal.

Observability, in software, refers to the **ability to understand the state of a system and its behavior** by collecting, analyzing, and presenting data about its various components and interactions. This enables engineers to diagnose and resolve issues and make informed decisions about system health and performance.

Observability is **critical for ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance** of modern systems, and is becoming increasingly important as software continues to play a larger role in our daily lives.

Fortunately, in the Rust ecosystem, we have [Tokio Tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) which is a powerful framework for **instrumenting** Rust programs to collect structured, event-based diagnostic information. It provides a convenient and flexible API for collecting and viewing traces of events in your application and you can easily **add context and structure to your traces**, making it easier to identify bottlenecks and debug issues.

## Shuttle logs

A while ago, I wrote a [post](https://robertohuertas.com/2023/01/09/shuttle-rust-backend-deployment/) about [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/), where I explained how ridiculously easy it is to deploy a Rust backend to the cloud by using their [CLI tool](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/quick-start).

[Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) is still in beta, and although its observability features are not really polished yet, they offer [support](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/telemetry) for [Tokio Tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) and a way to [view logs](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/telemetry#viewing-logs) by using their CLI tool.

By simply running `cargo shuttle logs --follow`, you will be able to see something like this:

![shuttle logs](https://robertohuertas.com/assets/images/shuttle-datadog/shuttle-cli-logs.png)

This is great for simple applications, but what if you want to send your logs to a **more powerful tool** like [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com)? Well, in this post, **I'll show you how to do it**.

## Datadog

[Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) is a **monitoring and observability platform** that provides a **single pane of glass** for your infrastructure and applications. It is a **cloud-based** service that allows you to **collect, aggregate and analyze** your data, and it is **extremely powerful**.

> As a disclaimer, I must say that I'm currently working at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com), so I'm a bit biased, but I'm also a huge fan of the product and I think it's a great tool for developers 😅.

Most of the time, the easiest way to send anything to the [Datadog platform](https://www.datadoghq.com/observability-platform/) is by using the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/), but in this case, as **we cannot install it** in any way, we will use a **small library I created for the occasion** called [dd-tracing-layer](https://crates.io/crates/dd-tracing-layer), which happens to be using the [Datadog HTTP API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/) under the hood to send logs to the  [Datadog platform](https://www.datadoghq.com/observability-platform/).

## How to use tracing with Shuttle

If we check the [Shuttle documentation](https://docs.shuttle.rs/configuration/logs), we can read this:

> Shuttle will record anything your application writes to stdout, e.g. a tracing or log crate configured to write to stdout, or simply println!. By default, Shuttle will set up a global tracing subscriber behind the scenes.

```rust
// [...]
use tracing::info;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleAxum {
    info!("Running database migration");
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    // [...]
}
```

So, as you can see, it seems that the Shuttle macro is already instantiating and initializing a [tracing subscriber](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/trait.Subscriber.html) for us.

This is pretty **convenient for most of the simple cases**, but unfortunately, it's not enough for our purposes.

Ideally, if we had access to the underlying infrastructure, we could probably install the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) and configure it to send our logs directly to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com), or even use [AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/send-aws-services-logs-with-the-datadog-lambda-function/?tab=awsconsole) or [Azure Event Hub + Azure Functions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/azure/?tab=azurecliv20#log-collection) in case we were facing some specific cloud scenarios.

> You can check the [Datadog docs for log collection and integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/) if you want to learn more.

Those solutions are generally great because they allow us to remove the burden of sending our logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) from our application, thus becoming the **responsibility of the platform** itself.

If we could do something like that with [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/), it would be great. But, as we just mentioned, in the case of [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/), we **don't have access to the underlying infrastructure**, so we need to find a way to send our logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) from our application.

And that's what we are going to try to do in this post.

## Getting access to the subscriber

So, the basic idea is to add a new [tracing layer](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/layer/) to the subscriber which will be responsible for sending our logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com).

But for that, we'll need to get **access to the subscriber instance prior to its initialization**, and it turns out that [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) provides a way to do that just by disabling the default features on `shuttle-runtime` crate.

```toml
shuttle-runtime = { version = "*" default-features = false }
```

## Creating our project

As a walkthrough, we are going to create a new [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) project from scratch.

The idea is to build a simple REST API using [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) and send our logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) using the [dd-tracing-layer](https://crates.io/crates/dd-tracing-layer) crate.

Although I'm going to describe all the steps you need to take to make this work, you can see the **final state of the project** in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/robertohuertasm/shuttle-datadog-logs).

Feel free to use it as a reference.

### Initializing the project

First of all, we need to create a new [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) project. You can do that by using the [Shuttle CLI](https://docs.shuttle.rs/getting-started/cli):

```bash
cargo shuttle init --template axum
```

Follow the instructions and you should have a new project ready to go. I called mine `shuttle-datadog-logs`, but use the name you want.

### Adding some dependencies

In our example, we are going to be using [Shuttle Secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets), [Tokio Tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) and [dd-tracing-layer](https://crates.io/crates/dd-tracing-layer).

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7.4"
shuttle-axum = "0.42.0"
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.42.0", default-features = false }
tokio = "1"
# tracing
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter", "json", "time"] }
dd-tracing-layer = "0.1"
```

### Instrumenting a little bit the default project

Now that we have our dependencies ready, we can **start instrumenting** our project a little bit.

Note that we have added the `#[instrument]` macro to the `hello_world` function and added a `tracing::info!` and a `tracing::debug!` log to it. We have also added an info log to the `axum` function.

```rust
// [...]
use tracing::instrument;

#[instrument]
async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    tracing::info!("Saying hello");
    tracing::debug!("Saying hello for debug level only");
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = Router::new().route("/", get(hello_world));
    tracing::info!("Starting axum service");
    Ok(router.into())
}
```

At this point, if you try to run the project locally by using the `shuttle run` command, you should see none of our logs.

That's ok, as we haven't initialized a [tracing subscriber](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/trait.Subscriber.html) yet.


### Adding our tracing subscriber

The first thing we're going to do is to add a [tracing subscriber](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/trait.Subscriber.html) to our application.

Then we will add several [layers](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/layer/index.html) to it:

- [EnvFilter layer](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) to set the tracing level according to a variable's value.
- [Format layer](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/format/index.html) to format the logs. We will be using JSON format.
- [Datadog Tracing layer](https://docs.rs/dd-tracing-layer/) to send our logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com).

Apart from that, we're also going to add support for [Shuttle Secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets).

Let's do it! Make sure your `axum` function looks like this:

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use dd_tracing_layer::{DatadogOptions, Region};
use shuttle_runtime::SecretStore;
use tracing::instrument;
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

// version of our app to be sent to Datadog
const VERSION: &'static str = "version:0.1.0";

// [...]

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(#[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    // getting the Datadog Key from the secrets
    let dd_api_key = secret_store
        .get("DD_API_KEY")
        .expect("DD_API_KEY not found");

    // getting the Datadog tags from the secrets
    let tags = secret_store
        .get("DD_TAGS")
        .map(|tags| format!("{},{}", tags, VERSION))
        .unwrap_or(VERSION.to_string());

    // getting the log level from the secrets and defaulting to info
    let log_level = secret_store.get("LOG_LEVEL").unwrap_or("INFO".to_string());

    // datadog tracing layer
    let dd_layer = dd_tracing_layer::create(
        DatadogOptions::new(
            // first parameter is the name of the service
            "shuttle-datadog-logs",
            // this is the Datadog API Key
            dd_api_key,
        )
        // this is the default, so it can be omitted
        .with_region(Region::US1)
        // adding some optional tags
        .with_tags(tags),
    );

    // filter layer
    let filter_layer =
        tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_new(log_level).expect("failed to set log level");

    // format layer
    let fmt_layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
        .with_ansi(true)
        .with_timer(tracing_subscriber::fmt::time::UtcTime::rfc_3339())
        .json()
        .flatten_event(true)
        .with_target(true)
        .with_span_list(true);

    // starting the tracing subscriber
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(filter_layer)
        .with(fmt_layer)
        .with(dd_layer)
        .init();

    // starting the server
    let router = Router::new().route("/", get(hello_world));
    tracing::info!("Starting axum service");
    Ok(router.into())
}
```

There are many things going on in this code, so take your time to go through it.

### Secrets

Before running our project, there's still a thing we have to deal with: **secrets**.

As you can see in the code above, we are using the `#[shuttle_runtime::Secrets]` macro to get the [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) API key, the tags and the log level.

[Shuttle Secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets) relies on having a `Secrets.toml` file in the root of our project containing all the secrets, and it also supports having a `Secrets.dev.toml` file for local development. You can learn more about this convention in the [Shuttle Secrets documentation](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets#local-secrets).

So, let's create two files in the root of our project:

`Secrets.dev.toml`

```toml
DD_API_KEY = "your-datadog-api-key"
DD_TAGS = "env:dev,service:shuttle-datadog-logs"
# setting info as the default log level, but debug for our project
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO,shuttle_datadog_logs=DEBUG"
```

and `Secrets.toml`

```toml
DD_API_KEY = "your-datadog-api-key"
DD_TAGS = "env:prod,service:shuttle-datadog-logs"
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
```

> Remember to add these files to your `.gitignore` file!

### Running the project

Now, run `cargo shuttle run` and go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see our "Hello, world!" message.

Alternatively, you can also use `curl` to test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000
```

You should be able to see the logs in your terminal now.

But remember... this endpoint was instrumented! So, if everything went well, we should be able to see the logs in [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs).

Let's check it out! 👀

It works! 🎉

## Conclusion

As you can see, it's pretty easy to send your logs to [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) from your [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) powered backend.

Again, you can see the full code in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/robertohuertasm/shuttle-datadog-logs).

I hope you've enjoyed it! 😁
