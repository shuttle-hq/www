# **Introducing ShuttleBytes: bite-sized Rust tutorials**

We’ve decided it was time to up our game and give back to the ecosystem by launching a mini series that demystifies Rust web development with an interactive, hands-on experience. Over the past 2 years, we’ve been doing our best to provide quality educational content to existing Rust developers and those just getting started, and this year, we want to take it to the next level.

**What is ShuttleBytes?**

1. **30 minute, live streamed tutorials** followed by a **Q&A**
2. Held **monthly** on the **[Shuttle Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle)** server
3. **Hosted** by **Joshua Mo** (the mastermind behind our blog)

**Tell me more**

Our first ShuttleBytes edition will be taking place on the **25th of January** where we will be covering “How to Write a REST API” in Rust. So make sure to swing by, say hi and learn something new.

P.S. This is a good opportunity to get your Rust-hesitant friends to give Rust a go!
