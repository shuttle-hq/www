## Introduction

At Shuttle, we enable users to easily deploy their Rust backend applications to our platform. Each
deployed application can receive HTTPS traffic at its default domain:
`<project-name>-<nonce>.shuttle.app`. We use a wildcard certificate that automatically covers all
subdomains of `shuttle.app`. However, users can use any custom domain they want, and we need an
SSL/TLS certificate for each.

To facilitate this, users can request a certificate for any domain they own through the
[Shuttle CLI](https://docs.shuttle.dev/docs/domain-names#set-up-ssl-certificate), after setting a
DNS record that points their domain to our public IP. To streamline this process, we needed a
simple, automated way to provision multiple certificates from a trusted certificate authority.
This is where the ACME protocol comes into play.

## The ACME Protocol

The ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment,
[RFC 8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555)) protocol was developed by the
[Internet Security Research Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Security_Research_Group)
for their Let's Encrypt service. It is an open standard that allows for the automated provisioning
and renewal of certificates from a certificate authority. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
is the most popular certificate authority that implements ACME, and in fact the only way to get a
certificate from them is with an ACME client. They’re a non-profit, with the express goal of making
the internet more secure by allowing anyone to easily obtain certificates, free-of-charge. We use
Let’s Encrypt at Shuttle, but there are other certificate authorities that implement the ACME
protocol, for example [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/) and
[Google Trust Services](https://pki.goog/).

Now we know a little bit at a high level about ACME, but how does it work in practice?

## ACME Challenges

The ACME protocol allows us to provision certificates from an ACME server programmatically. However,
for us to be allowed to provision a certificate for a given domain, we must first prove that we
control that domain. In the ACME paradigm that is done by completing a challenge, and in the current
version of the ACME standard, there are three
[challenge types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/).

### HTTP-01

This is the simplest and most commonly used challenge, and the one we currently use to support
custom domains on Shuttle. For this challenge, you need to start a server under the domain you are
requesting a certificate for, that is reachable by the ACME server (e.g. Let’s Encrypt) on port 80.
The ACME server will send an HTTP request to the endpoint
`http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<TOKEN>`, and it will expect a specific value in
the response, which we’ll go in depth on later.

The main drawbacks to using this challenge type, is that it does not support provisioning
certificates for wildcard domains. Furthermore, it requires you to serve the challenge response on
port 80, which depending on your infrastructure setup can be challenging.

For the practical part of this article, we’ll focus on this challenge type.

### DNS-01

This challenge requires you to prove that you control the DNS for a domain by putting a specific
value under a TXT record in the DNS zone for that domain. The ACME server will then do an
authoritative lookup for the record, and if it has the right value, you’ll be allowed to provision
a certificate. This can be challenging to automate, since you’re reliant on your DNS provider to
have an API you can call to set the TXT record.

At Shuttle, we use this challenge internally when we provision a certificate for our default
wildcard domain, `*.shuttle.app`. In the future, we will use it to allow users to request
certificates for wildcard custom domains, as this is the only challenge type that can be used for
wildcard certificates. We will then initiate the challenge on our end, before returning the value
to the user, along with instructions on how to set it in a TXT record in their DNS.

### TLS-ALPN-01

Like the HTTP-01 challenge, this challenge, which is developed as a
[separate standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8737), also requires you to run a
server on your domain that is reachable by the ACME server. But unlike HTTP-01, you don’t need to
serve it on port 80. You are required to start a TLS server on port 443, that responds to specific
connection attempts using the ALPN extension with identifying information. To prove that you control
the domain, when the ACME server makes a connection to an address that is resolved for your domain,
you need to present a self-signed certificate with some identifying information, as well as a signed
challenge token.

## Using an ACME client in Rust with `instant_acme`

It’s time to see how this all works in practice, in Rust! Thanks to the Rust open-source community,
we don’t have to implement our ACME client from scratch. There are a couple of crates to choose
from, but the most up-to-date and actively maintained is the
[`instant_acme`](https://github.com/djc/instant-acme) crate, built on top of `tokio` and `rustls`.
It supports all the ACME challenge types mentioned above.

### Creating an ACME Account

The first step in the ACME certificate provisioning flow is creating an
[ACME account](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.2), which `instant_acme`
makes very simple. When we call `Account::create`, the library sets up a Hyper client under the hood
and creates an
[ECDSA key pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm), and
there we have it, our ACME client! We’ll re-use this client and key pair throughout the provisioning
process.

The public key from the key pair will be included in the account creation request, and the request,
as well as future requests using this client, will be signed using the private key. We’ll use the
Let’s Encrypt staging environment for this example, since it’s
[recommended for development and testing](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/).

```rust
use instant_acme::{LetsEncrypt, NewAccount, Account};
use anyhow::Context;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let account = NewAccount {
        // Optionally add a list of contact URIs (like mailto:info@your-domain.com).
        contact: &[],
        terms_of_service_agreed: true,
        only_return_existing: false,
    };

    // We'll use methods on the returned account struct for future calls to the ACME server.
    let (account, _credentials) = Account::create(&account, &LetsEncrypt::Staging.url(), None)
        .await
        .context("failed to create acme account")?;
}
```

### Creating an ACME Order

With our account set up, we’re ready to create an
[order](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.3) for a certificate. The order
struct is a simple state machine, in accordance with the ACME spec. It has a status, a list of
authorizations and an optional certificate. We’ll go through the various steps of the order to drive
the state to `Ready`, at which point we’ll be allowed to request a certificate.

![Diagram showing the order state machine](/images/blog/provisioning-tls-certificates-with-acme/order-state-machine.svg)

The order will have one authorization per domain we request a certificate for, that the ACME server
requires the client to complete. For each authorization, we need to chose which challenge type we
want to complete, e.g. HTTP-01 or DNS-01. For this example, we’ll use an HTTP-01 challenge.

> The instant_acme repository provides an
[example using a DNS-01 challenge](https://github.com/djc/instant-acme/blob/main/examples/provision.rs),
which the example below using HTTP-01 is largely based on.

```rust
use instant_acme::{
   AuthorizationStatus, ChallengeType, Identifier, NewOrder
};
use anyhow::{bail, Context};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    [...]

    let domain = "my-domain.com";

		// Using the account we created earlier, create an order for our domain.
    let mut order = account
        .new_order(&NewOrder {
            identifiers: &[Identifier::Dns(domain.to_string())],
        })
        .await
        .context("failed to order certificate")?;

		// Request authorizations for our order from the ACME server.
    let authorizations = order
        .authorizations()
        .await
        .context("failed to retrieve order authorizations")?;

    // There should only be 1 authorization as we only provided 1 domain above.
    let authorization = authorizations
        .first()
        .context("there should be one authorization")?;

    if !matches!(authorization.status, AuthorizationStatus::Pending) {
        bail!("order should be pending");
    }

		// We want to complete an HTTP-01 challenge for this example, so we
		// extract it from the authorization. It holds the token we need to
		// complete the challenge.
    let challenge = authorization
        .challenges
        .iter()
        .find(|c| c.r#type == ChallengeType::Http01)
        .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!("no http01 challenge found"))?;
}
```

### Setting Up An HTTP-01 Challenge Server

Now, as I mentioned earlier, to complete an HTTP-01 challenge we need to serve a specific value at
the `http://my-domain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/{*token}` endpoint. The token will be in the
challenge we received from the ACME server with our order. For any request to this endpoint, we will
return the same token, signed with the private key from our ACME account credentials, in the
response body. This signed token is known as a
[key authorization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.1).

Before we set the challenge to ready, we need to persist the challenge token and key authorization
somewhere, so we can serve it in response to ACME server requests. At Shuttle, we use an external
database for this, since there are many instances of our ACME client running at a given time,
behind a load balancer, and they all need to be able to complete any challenge. But in the interest
of keeping this example simple, we’ll just store them in a `HashMap`.

![Diagram showing the flow of an ACME HTTP-01 challenge](/images/blog/provisioning-tls-certificates-with-acme/http-01-challenge.svg)

To serve the challenge endpoint, we’ll set up a simple Axum server, but you could use any framework
of your choosing, or even just a simple Hyper server if you want something bare-bones. We’ll start
by creating some utility functions to set up our Axum server.

```rust
use axum::{
    extract::{Path, State},
    http::StatusCode,
    routing::any,
    Router,
};
use instant_acme::ChallengeType;

/// Set up a simple acme server to respond to http01 challenges.
pub fn acme_router(challenges: HashMap<String, String>) -> Router {
    Router::new()
        .route(
            "/.well-known/acme-challenge/{*token}",
            any(http01_challenge),
        )
        .with_state(challenges)
}

/// Respond to HTTP-01 challenges by extracting the token from the path of the request, and then
/// using the token to look up the matching key authorization in our internal state.
pub async fn http01_challenge(
    State(challenges): State<HashMap<String, String>>,
    Path(token): Path<String>,
) -> Result<String, StatusCode> {
    tracing::info!(%token, "received HTTP-01 ACME challenge");

    if let Some(key_auth) = challenges.get(&token) {
        Ok({
            tracing::info!(%key_auth, "responding to ACME challenge");
            key_auth.clone()
        })
    } else {
        tracing::warn!(%token, "didn't find acme challenge");
        Err(StatusCode::NOT_FOUND)
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    [...]

    let challenge = authorization
        .challenges
        .iter()
        .find(|c| c.r#type == ChallengeType::Http01)
        .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!("no http01 challenge found"))?;

    let challenges = HashMap::from([(
        challenge.token.clone(),
        order.key_authorization(challenge).as_str().to_string(),
    )]);

    tracing::info!("challenges: {:?}", challenges);

    // We use the utility function we created below to configure our Axum router.
    let acme_router = acme_router(challenges);

    // NOTE: when the ACME server sends the challenge request to your domain, it will always
    // connect on port 80, which is specified in the standard.
    // At Shuttle we have a load balancer in front of the ACME client, which listens for ACME
    // requests on port 80, and forwards them to the challenge server running on a different port.
    let address = "0.0.0.0:5002";
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:5002").await.unwrap();

    // Start the Axum server as a background task, so it's running while we complete the challenge
    // in the next steps.
    tokio::task::spawn(async move { axum::serve(listener, acme_router).await.unwrap() });

    tracing::info!("serving HTTP-01 challenge server at: 0.0.0.0:5002");
}
```

### Initiate The HTTP-01 Challenge

Now that our HTTP-01 challenge server is up and running in the background, we can proceed with our
order. The next step is to communicate to the ACME server that we are ready to complete the
challenge.

```rust
use anyhow::{bail, Context};
use instant_acme::OrderStatus;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    [...]

    // Notify the ACME server that we are ready to complete the challenge.
    order
        .set_challenge_ready(&challenge.url)
        .await
        .context("failed to notify ACME server that challenge is ready")?;

    // We now need to wait until the order reaches an end-state. We refresh the order in a loop,
    // with exponential backoff, until the order is either ready or invalid (for example if our
    // challenge server responded with the wrong key authorization).
    let mut tries = 1u8;
    let mut delay = Duration::from_millis(250);
    loop {
        tokio::time::sleep(delay).await;
        let state = order.refresh().await.unwrap();
        if let OrderStatus::Ready | OrderStatus::Invalid = state.status {
            tracing::info!("order state: {:#?}", state);
            break;
        }

        delay *= 2;
        tries += 1;
        if tries < 15 {
            tracing::info!(?state, tries, "order is not ready, waiting {delay:?}");
        } else {
            tracing::error!(
                tries,
                "timed out before order reached ready state: {state:#?}"
            );
            bail!("timed out before order reached ready state");
        }
    }

    let state = order.state();
    if state.status != OrderStatus::Ready {
        bail!("unexpected order status: {:?}", state.status);
    }

    tracing::info!(?state, "challenge completed");
```

### Requesting a certificate with a CSR

Now that the challenge is completed, we are ready to
[finalize the order](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.4) and request the
certificate. First, we’ll need to create a
[certificate signing request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) (CSR).
Creating the CSR is outside the scope of the `instant_acme` crate, so we’ll need to use another
library for that, [`rcgen`](https://github.com/rustls/rcgen).

While requesting the certificate should be fast, it won’t be ready immediately, so here again we
will poll until it’s ready.

```rust
use anyhow::{bail, Context};
use rcgen::{CertificateParams, DistinguishedName, KeyPair};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    [...]
    // Create a CSR for our domain.
	let mut params = CertificateParams::new(vec![domain.to_owned()])?;
    params.distinguished_name = DistinguishedName::new();
    let private_key = KeyPair::generate()?;
    let signing_request = params.serialize_request(&private_key)?;

    // DER encode the CSR and use it to request our certificate from the ACME server.
    order
        .finalize(signing_request.der())
        .await
        .context("failed to finalize order")?;

    // Poll for certificate, do this for a few rounds.
    let mut cert_chain_pem: Option<String> = None;
    let mut retries = 5;
    while cert_chain_pem.is_none() && retries > 0 {
        cert_chain_pem = order
            .certificate()
            .await
            .context("failed to get the certificate for order")?;
        retries -= 1;
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    }

    let Some(chain) = cert_chain_pem else {
        bail!("failed to get certificate for order before timeout");
    };

    tracing::info!("certificate chain:\n\n{}", chain);
    tracing::info!("private key:\n\n{}", private_key.serialize_pem());
    Ok(())
}
```

And there we have it! A certificate we can serve for my-domain.com. At Shuttle, we store these
certificates in a database, then serve them in the TLS handler of our Pingora based proxy.

Note that the example in this article will fail if ran locally, since the HTTP-01 challenge server
has to be served on port 80 on the IP that the domain DNS record points to. If you want to test it
locally, you can use Pebble, a small and simple ACME test server. You can see an example of that,
and the full source code for this article, in the [repository](https://github.com/oddgrd/acme-article).
