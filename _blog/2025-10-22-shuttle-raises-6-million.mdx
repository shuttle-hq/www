Today, we're announcing that Shuttle has raised $6 million to accelerate our mission: make building and operating backends as simple as writing code with AI. In short, Shuttle is the AI platform engineer, helping builders go from idea to production in minutes.

Our goal is to be the go-to cloud infrastructure platform for developers building with tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot. As AI accelerates coding, infrastructure has become the bottleneck. Our mission has always been to remove it.

To get there, we've raised $6M from world-class partners and operators, including:

- Y Combinator
- Global Founders Capital
- Thomas Dohmke, former CEO of GitHub
- Calvin French-Owen, Founder of Segment
- Senior leaders from OpenAI, Deel, Confluent, and others

Our vision is simple: Backends must be as composable and understandable as code to unlock the next wave of AI-assisted development.

"In the era of AI, developers are writing apps faster than ever with the help of coding agents like GitHub Copilot or Claude Code. Deploying and running these applications as fast as creating them is the next major frontier," said Thomas Dohmke, former CEO of GitHub. "And Shuttle is uniquely positioned to be a leader in this space and enable quick iteration cycles for every full-stack builder."

## Why now?

AI is changing how software is built. Developers are becoming orchestrators who prompt systems to generate code, wire APIs, and scaffold products. As a result, the amount of code being generated and pushed to production has exploded, but the backend, with all the queues, storage, networking, security, and deployments, still takes days of work to make it real.

The definition of "developer" is expanding to include people who may not come from traditional engineering backgrounds. This shift means more individuals are now building and deploying software than ever before. This not only means our audience is getting bigger - it also makes the need for simpler, more accessible infrastructure greater than ever.

This is where Shuttle comes in. We are building an AI-native, language-agnostic platform where code and infrastructure live together and are reviewable by people and AI.

## What we've proven so far

We started in Rust, where developers demanded performance and a great developer experience. Shuttle is now one of the top choices for deploying Rust backends in minutes. It is used by tens of thousands of developers, and recently crossed 130,000 deployments. Teams describe Shuttle as "Vercel for backends," and our PMF survey shows strong resonance: 60% of developers would be "very disappointed" if they could no longer use Shuttle. We have also built an active and engaged community around our mission.

## What this funding enables

We're taking the zero-config experience that Rust developers love and bringing it to every language. We are also making the Shuttle experience even more integrated with the AI coding workflows. In other words, we're building the expert co-pilot that provisions and wires your entire cloud stack for you.

Imagine a compact infrastructure-as-data spec that is entirely language-agnostic. With seamless integrations, you'll be able to deploy applications from within Cursor or with the help of Claude Code or GitHub Copilot. No YAML, no Terraform, no CI glue. Use this to deploy to AWS, GCP, or your own cloud with opinionated defaults and guardrails. We will provide reusable backend patterns for APIs, jobs, queues, vector stores, and more. And if you're building within a team, you will be able to spin up preview environments, and get granular access control, cost and architecture suggestions.

We're launching the Beta of our new platform in the upcoming weeks. Stay tuned for more updates and get in touch via [discord](https://discord.com/invite/shuttle) or email if you want to know more!
