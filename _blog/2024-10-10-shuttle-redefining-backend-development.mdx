# Shuttle’s New Platform

Today we’re introducing the new Shuttle platform! We've supercharged what developers love about Shuttle, combining our powerful developer experience with enterprise-grade infrastructure. For developers, we've kept it simple and intuitive - no complex configs, just focus on your Rust code. On the production side, we've implemented VM-level isolation, increased reliability and scalability to meet real-world demands. From solo developers to enterprise teams, Shuttle now offers the perfect blend of ease and production-ready robustness.

## **Our Vision**

Shuttle is a new way of building and deploying cloud applications. We make dealing with cloud infrastructure simple and enjoyable so developers can focus on creating great products. Today, developers face a choice between the flexibility of large cloud providers and the simplicity of PaaS solutions, each with limitations. At Shuttle, we’re forging a middle path—prioritising simplicity while preserving flexibility. Our open-source framework, [***Infrastructure from Code* (IfC)**](https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2022/05/09/ifc), combined with our state-of-the-art platform, lets developers annotate their code to configure infrastructure and deploy instantly. IfC enables developers using GenAI to optimise cloud infrastructure setup and automate complex tasks, saving vast amounts of time. 

### Backstory

Over the past year we've seen Rust adoption increase by 64%, and our user base has tripled to 15,000+ developers. The number of projects deployed on Shuttle? That's grown five times over. It's been an exciting journey, and to embrace this growth and support more production use-cases, we've built something extraordinary. We're excited to introduce our new platform that's more scalable, secure, and powerful than ever!

## Introducing the New Platform Public Preview

The new Shuttle platform takes what developers already love and cranks it up a notch. We've kept the great developer experience you're used to and combined it with production-ready infrastructure, ready to tackle your most ambitious projects.

- **For Developers**: The seamless, intuitive experience you love — now smoother than ever. Our unique approach eliminates the need for complex configuration files or deep cloud expertise. With Shuttle you focus on writing your Rust code, while we handle the complexities of the cloud - deployment, scaling, and infrastructure management. Features like automatic database provisioning and effortless API integration remain at your fingertips from within your IDE, but are now enhanced with even greater reliability and performance.
- **For Production**: With a Pro-tier experience tailored for putting things in production, building and operating distributed systems at scale is now a joy. We’ve upgraded our observability stack for even better uptime and faster incident response, letting you rest easy while we handle service restoration. Shuttle’s enhanced capabilities for horizontal scaling, tenant isolation, security patching, and fault tolerance ensure your app scales seamlessly as demand grows. Watch out for exciting new features in this space!

Whether you're a solo developer working on a passion project or an enterprise team deploying mission-critical applications, the new Shuttle platform has you covered. The perfect balance of development ease and production readiness.

## What's new?

### Scalability

Our new system can handle 10 times more concurrent requests, 10 times more active projects with high uptime, and 20 times more concurrent builds. In simple terms, we've gone from a single-stage rocket to a fully reusable spacecraft. More payload, faster turnaround, and ready to explore new frontiers.

### Reliability

We've put in place workload isolation and beefed up our monitoring. This means one resource-hungry project can't slow down others, and we can spot and fix issues faster than ever.

### Security

We implemented VM-level isolation. Now, each project runs in its own little "world", completely separate from others. 

### Builder Service

We've completely revamped how we build projects. Our new system is more scalable, flexible and is built to handle a wider variety of build requirements.

### Laying the Groundwork for the Future

By adopting container builds and a modular architecture, we've opened doors to exciting possibilities. While Rust remains our focus, we're now positioned to potentially support multiple languages in the future. Imagine bringing Shuttle's simple, joyful backend experience to your favourite language. It's ambitious, and we're one step closer to creating the best cloud experience for all developers.

### New Domain

We have changed our domain name to shuttle.dev! The new platform is available to use via the [shuttle.dev](https://www.shuttle.dev) console. However, if you're an existing user looking to access the old platform and navigate between the two, you can find instructions [here](https://docs.shuttle.dev/introduction/platform-update).

## What does this mean for you?

Whether you're a new user or have been with us from the start - you're in for a treat. Here's what you can expect from our new platform:

- Better security with VM-level isolation between projects.
- Ability to scale bigger and faster, handling sudden traffic reliably.
- More stable performance across the board, unaffected by other busy projects.
- Support for more complex builds, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
- Automatic restarts for improved reliability and uptime.
