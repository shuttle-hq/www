### Discussing cutting-edge advancements in the Rust ecosystem

If you're looking to stay ahead of the curve on all things Rust, connect with fellow Rustaceans and expand your skills, we'd love to have you join us at **ShuttleLabs**. Each month we will be hosting a thought leader from the space, diving into the hottest topics and creating an opportunity for discussion that can't be found anywhere else.

### Why we decided to start ShuttleLabs

Rust is growing faster than its resources and it's difficult to stay up-to-date on all the advancements in the space. We hope that ShuttleLabs will solve this problem and create an environment for both seasoned and new Rust devs to continually learn, share their perspective, and hear from great contributors in the ecosystem.

In our first session we will be exploring **Async In Rust, with Stefan Baumgartner!** Async in Rust is a big topic as Rust deals with async at a low level: using futures and executors, as well as being able to programatically create your own async runtime!

The details of the talk are below:

Topic: **Async in Rust**

Speaker: **Stefan Baumgartner** (@ddprrt on X)

Date: **February 6th, 15:00 (UTC)**
