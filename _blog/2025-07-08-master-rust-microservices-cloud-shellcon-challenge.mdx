## Master Rust and Cloud Development: Build Production-Ready Microservices with ShellCon

Looking to level up your Rust skills while learning modern cloud deployment? ShellCon offers a unique hands-on learning experience that combines Rust microservices development with Shuttle Cloud deployment. This comprehensive full-stack project will take you from local development to cloud deployment while solving real-world performance optimization problems.

### What is ShellCon?

ShellCon is an innovative learning approach that transforms Rust and cloud development education into a practical, project-based experience. Instead of working through abstract tutorials, you'll build and optimize a complete microservices architecture with three interconnected Rust services and a React dashboard.

#### Development Workflow

**Phase 1: Local Development** - Set up and run all three services locally, then verify the React dashboard connects properly to each service endpoint.

**Phase 2: Performance Optimization** - Solve four distinct performance challenges across the microservices, each focusing on different aspects of Rust optimization.

**Phase 3: Cloud Deployment** - Deploy your optimized services to Shuttle Cloud and validate everything works in a production environment.

### What You'll Build

You'll construct a complete microservices ecosystem consisting of three specialized Rust services working together through REST APIs. Your development journey involves three critical phases:

#### The Microservices Architecture

**aqua-monitor**: An environmental monitoring service that handles sensor data collection, tank readings, and system status endpoints. You'll work with async I/O patterns and HTTP client optimization.

**species-hub**: A database service managing species information, feeding schedules, and related data. This service teaches SQL optimization and efficient database interaction patterns.

**aqua-brain**: An analytics engine that processes data from the other services to generate insights and analysis. You'll focus on memory optimization and efficient string handling.

**React Dashboard**: A modern frontend that connects to all three services through REST APIs, providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities.

### What You'll Learn

ShellCon offers a comprehensive learning experience that combines project-based learning with real-world architecture. You'll build a complete application with production-like microservices while getting immediate feedback on your optimizations.

Through this hands-on approach, you'll learn:

- **Rust Development:** Async/await patterns, non-blocking I/O, SQLx with PostgreSQL, heap allocation optimization, and Axum connection pooling
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Shuttle Cloud deployment, resilient microservices creation, Docker containers, and multi-stage deployment configuration
- **Frontend Integration:** Connecting React to Rust microservices, designing efficient RESTful endpoints, and implementing cross-service health checks

### Challenge Structure

Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of Rust performance optimization:

#### Four Key Optimization Challenges

**1. Async I/O (aqua-monitor)**: Fix blocking operations in async code to improve tank readings performance.

**2. SQL Queries (species-hub)**: Optimize database queries to enhance species database efficiency.

**3. Memory Management (aqua-brain)**: Minimize heap allocations in the analytics engine using Rust's ownership system.

**4. HTTP Client Pooling (aqua-monitor)**: Implement connection reuse patterns to boost network performance.

## Getting Started is Simple

Ready to begin your Rust and cloud development journey? The setup process is straightforward:

1. **Clone the repository** and install prerequisites (Rust, Docker, Node.js, Shuttle CLI)
2. **Launch the three microservices** locally using the provided scripts
3. **Start the React dashboard** and verify all connections work
4. **Begin solving the four optimization challenges** at your own pace
5. **Deploy to Shuttle Cloud** and validate your solutions in production
