In this article we’ll be talking about Serde, how you can use it in your Rust application as well as some more advanced tips and tricks.

## What is serde?

The `serde` Rust crate is used to efficiently serialize and deserialize data in many formats. It does this by providing two traits you can use, aptly named `Deserialize` and `Serialize`. Being one of the most well-known crates in the ecosystem, it currently supports (de)serialization to over 20 types.

To get started, you’ll want to install the crate into your Rust application:

```bash
cargo add serde
```

## Using serde

### Deserializing and Serializing data

The simple way to serialize and deserialize data is by adding the serde `derive` feature. This adds a macro that you can use to implement `Deserialize` and `Serialize` automatically - you can do this with the `--features` flag (`-F` for short):

```bash
cargo add serde -F derive
```

Then we can add a macro to any struct or enum that we want to implement `Deserialize` or `Serialize` for:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct MyStruct {
	message: String,
    // ... the rest of your fields
}
```

This allows us to use any crate with `serde` support to convert between said formats. As an example, let’s use `serde-json` to convert to and from JSON format:

```rust
use serde_json::json;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    message: String,
}

fn to_and_from_json() {
    let json = json!({"message": "Hello world!"});
    let my_struct: MyStruct = serde_json::from_str(&json).unwrap();

    assert_eq!(my_struct, MyStruct { message: "Hello world!".to_string());

    assert!(serde_json::to_string(my_struct).is_ok());
}
```

If you’re interested in using `serde-json` for your Rust application, we have an article talking about JSON parsing libraries which you can check out [here.](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2024/01/18/parsing-json-rust)  

We can also deserialize and serialize to/from many sources including from a file stream I/O, a JSON byte array and more!

### Implementing Deserialize and Serialize manually

As a side note, you can also implement `Deserialize` and `Serialize` manually! This is quite complicated, but for now we will stick with a simple implementation. Here is a simple implementation for serializing of the `i32` primitive type. 

```rust
use serde::{Serializer, Serialize};

impl Serialize for i32 {
    fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
    where
        S: Serializer,
    {
        serializer.serialize_i32(*self)
    }
}
```

To be able to convert the type, `serde` internally requires us to use a type that implements `Serializer`.  To implement `Serialize` for a type that isn’t directly a primitive, we can extend this by serializing into a primitive, then converting into whatever type we want from the primitive. If we want custom serialization for structs, we can also do the same with use of the `SerializeStruct` trait:

```rust
use serde::ser::{Serialize, Serializer, SerializeStruct};

struct Color {
    r: u8,
    g: u8,
    b: u8,
}

impl Serialize for Color {
    fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
    where
        S: Serializer,
    {
        // 3 is the number of fields in the struct.
        let mut state = serializer.serialize_struct("Color", 3)?;
        state.serialize_field("r", &self.r)?;
        state.serialize_field("g", &self.g)?;
        state.serialize_field("b", &self.b)?;
        state.end()
    }
}
```
Note that to serialize a field, the field type also needs to implement `Serialize`. If you have a custom type that doesn't implement `Serialize`, you will either need to implement `Serialize` or use a `Serialize` derive macro (if the struct/enum type holds types that all implement `Serialize`).

The `Deserialize` trait is a little bit different and is a fair bit more complicated to implement. To be able to deserialize to a type, the type itself needs to implement `Sized` which means that there are a number of types which can’t use this trait (for example `&str`) because they are unsized types. To deserialize a type, you also need to use a type that implements the `Visitor` trait. The `serde` documentation provides the below example for an `I32Visitor` type that attempts to deserialize multiple types to `i32`:

```rust
use std::fmt;

use serde::de::{self, Visitor};

struct I32Visitor;

impl<'de> Visitor<'de> for I32Visitor {
    type Value = i32;

    fn expecting(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        formatter.write_str("an integer between -2^31 and 2^31")
    }

    fn visit_i8<E>(self, value: i8) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: de::Error,
    {
        Ok(i32::from(value))
    }

    fn visit_i32<E>(self, value: i32) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: de::Error,
    {
        Ok(value)
    }

    fn visit_i64<E>(self, value: i64) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: de::Error,
    {
        use std::i32;
        if value >= i64::from(i32::MIN) && value <= i64::from(i32::MAX) {
            Ok(value as i32)
        } else {
            Err(E::custom(format!("i32 out of range: {}", value)))
        }
    }

    // Similar for other methods:
    //   - visit_i16
    //   - visit_u8
    //   - visit_u16
    //   - visit_u32
    //   - visit_u64
}
```

As you can see, the implementation is quite large! However, it also allows us to make the implementation much simpler. By implementing the `Visitor` trait, we can pass the Visitor type to our `Deserialize` method:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Deserializer};

impl<'de> Deserialize<'de> for i32 {
    fn deserialize<D>(deserializer: D) -> Result<i32, D::Error>
    where
        D: Deserializer<'de>,
    {
        deserializer.deserialize_i32(I32Visitor)
    }
}
```

There is also documentation on deserializing structs which you can find [here.](https://serde.rs/deserialize-struct.html) However, generally speaking it is recommended that you use the `derive` feature macros as the manual implementation (as seen on the page itself) is quite large. The implementation involves mostly using a visitor that can visit a map or sequence then iterate through the elements to deserialize it. 

### Using serde attributes

When it comes to serde, the crate also has a number of useful attribute macros that we can use on our types to allow things like field renaming when deserializing a field or serializing to a struct. One of the best examples of this would be when you’re interacting with an API written in a language that may have a key that is a reserved keyword in Rust. You can add a `#[serde(rename)]` attribute macro like so:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    #[serde(rename = "type")]
    kind: String
}
```

This allows you to get around the issue!

You can also rename all of your fields to another casing by using the `rename_all` attribute:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct MyStruct {
    my_message: String
}
```

Now when you serialize this struct, `my_message` should automatically turn into `myMessage`! Perfect for working with APIs written in other languages or with different conventions.

If you’d prefer to not wrap fields in `Option`, you can also implement default values by using `#[serde(default)]`. This simply allows fields to be filled in with default values instead of automatically erroring out. You can also use `#[serde(default = "path")]` to be able to point to functions for providing the automatic default. For example, this struct and function:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct MyStruct {
	#[serde(path = "my_function")]
    my_message: String,
}

fn my_function() -> String {
    "Hello world!".to_string()
}
```

`serde` also offers other useful attributes, like being able to deny unknown fields using `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` on top of the struct. This allows you to make sure that the struct is exactly as-is when serializing and deserializing. 

### Deserializing and Serializing enums

Let’s examine this enum type:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
enum MyEnum {
	Data { id: String, data: Value },
    SomeOtherData { id: i32, name: String }
}
```

Note that when converting to and from this enumstruct, it can take two options:

- A String field named “id” and a JSON value with the key “data” (this can be a map, a value or anything that the `Json` value can hold)
- An `i32` field named “id” and a `String` field named “name”

You can then match the enum variant for further processing. 

When the first enum variant is written in JSON, you can see that it should correspond with this:

```json
{
    "Data": {
        "id": "your_id_here",
        "data": { .. }
    }
}
```

This type of data is “externally tagged” - meaning the data is characterized by the identifier being on the outside of the JSON object. We can add inline tagging so that the identifier is on the inside of the crate - let’s have a look at what this would look like:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[serde(tag = "type")]
enum MyEnum {
	Data { id: String, data: Value },
    SomeOtherData { id: i32, name: String }
}
```

Now the JSON representation looks like this:

```json
{
    "type": "Data",
    "id": "your_id_here",
    "data": { .. }
}
```

## Crates that work well with Serde

### serde_with

`serde_with` is a crate that provides custom de/serialization helpers to use with `serde`'s `with` annotation. It works by replacing the `with` annotation with a new one called `serde_as`. With this new attribute macro you can do quite a few things:

- De/serializing a type using `Display` and `FromStr` traits.
- Support arrays larger than 32 elements.
- Skip serializing empty Option types
- Deserialize a comma separated list into a `Vec<String>`

To use `serde_with`, you need to add it to your Cargo.toml either manually or by using the following command:

```bash
cargo add serde_with
```

Then you need to add `serde_as` to the type you want to use it for, like so:

```rust
#[serde_as]
#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Foo {
    // Serialize with Display, deserialize with FromStr
    #[serde_as(as = "DisplayFromStr")]
    bar: u8,
}
```

This struct lets you convert to/from a string but have the type itself in your Rust struct be `u8`! Pretty useful, right?

This crate also comes with a [guide](https://docs.rs/serde_with/3.5.0/serde_with/guide/index.html) that you can use to fully capitalise on `serde_with`. Overall, a strong companion crate for `serde`.

### serde_bytes

`serde_bytes` is a crate that allows for optimised handling of `&[u8]` and `Vec<u8>` types - while `serde` is capable of dealing these types by itself, some formats can be de/serialized more efficiently. It’s quite simple to use - you just add it to your Cargo.toml and then add it via the `#[serde(with = "serde_bytes")]` annotation like so:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    #[serde(with = "serde_bytes")]
    byte_buf: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Overall, an easy to use and simple crate that improves performance without much knowledge required.
