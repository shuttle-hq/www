Following the launch of our new platform late last year, we're updating our pricing structure to better reflect our evolution into a production-ready platform that developers can rely on for their most critical services.

We're particularly excited to introduce our **new Growth Tier**, designed specifically for teams with more complex production workloads that need to handle significantly more traffic and team collaboration features.

We want to be transparent about what's changing and why these changes will better serve you, whether you are an individual developer or a growing team.

## Why We're Updating Our Pricing

1. Provide production-ready infrastructure with enhanced isolation, reliability, and monitoring across all tiers
2. Balancing generosity of the free tier with long-term platform sustainability
3. Making it even clearer what you get and what you pay for, responding to some of your feedback
4. Support users with rapid scaling needs
5. Enable team collaboration features

We've carefully balanced these adjustments by significantly increasing computing power and adding capabilities that matter most for real-world applications.

## Our Updated Pricing Tiers

### Community Tier: Focused and More Powerful

**Free Forever**

We've enhanced our free tier to better serve developers learning Rust and get meaningful projects off the ground:

- **5x more computing power**: 0.25 vCPU (from 0.05)
- **2.5x more memory**: 0.5GB RAM (up from 0.2GB)
- **Custom domain support** included
- **Running Projects**: 1 project (from 3) perfect for showcasing what you can do in Rust
- **Spot Instance**: Instances may occasionally restart to maintain optimal platform performance
- **7x longer log retention**: 7 days (up from 1 day)
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Basic resource usage metrics through third-party integrations
- **Simplified builds**: 100 build minutes per month
- **Database storage**: 0.5GB (plenty to start small or experiment)

While we've reduced the number of projects, each project now gets significantly more computing resources, making it possible to build and run more demanding applications.

### Pro Tier: Production-Ready Infrastructure

**$20/month + usage** with a 14 day free trial! (excluding usage)

If you're running production apps or you've outgrown the Community tier, the Pro plan is here to keep you covered:

- **Reserved instances**: Dedicated resources with full VM isolation
- **Scalable vCPU & Memory** to support larger need**s**
- **3 projects included:** Down from 15
- **Add more projects: Add** up to 10 projects
- **Minimum size for additional projects:** 0.5 vCPU and 1GB of Memory
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Custom application metrics, logs & traces
- **14-day log retention** (up from 7)
- **Network egress included adjusted to 1GB** (from 10GB).
- **Shared database storage included is now 0.5GB** (from 10GB).
- **Usage-based pricing** for more flexibility
- **Enhanced support**: 1-business day response time and migration assistance

We've moved to a more flexible usage-based model where you only pay for what you need beyond the basic allocation, focusing on a stable, production-ready environment - plus our new monitoring integration helps you keep everything running smoothly.

### Growth Tier: Scale with Confidence (New!)

**Starting at $250/month + usage** with a 14 day free trial! (excluding usage)

For teams with more complex production workloads or the need to handle more traffic.

- **10 projects included** (scalable up to 50)
- **Minimum size for additional projects:** 0.5 vCPU and 1GB of Memory
- **Horizontal scaling** with configurable replicas (up to 10 instances per project)
- **Zero downtime deploys** with rolling deployments
- **Load balancing** up to 1,000 requests per second
- **Dedicated database** for consistent performance
- **Team access** for up to 10 users
- **30-day log retention**
- **Priority business support** in either Discord or Slack with a dedicated channel

If your organization needs collaboration features or you want to scale seamlessly, Growth Tier offers robust infrastructure without the complexity of managing it yourself.

### Enterprise Tier: Built for Big Ambitions (Coming Soon)

**Custom pricing + usage**

For large organizations with advanced security, compliance, or custom infrastructure needs. 

- **Bring your own cloud or single tenant** options
- **Custom hardware configurations**
- **Multi-region flexibility**
- **Advanced Security & Compliance**
- **Custom CI Pipelines**
- **Priority support** with custom SLA
- **Architecture design reviews**

If you have strict operational, security, or compliance needs - or want to integrate Shuttle deeply into your existing ecosystem - stay tuned for Enterprise.

## Supporting Your Transition

We understand that pricing changes can impact your projects. To ensure a smooth transition:

- **Existing projects**: Will continue running with current resources for 30 days
- **Migration support**: Our team is available in Discord to help with questions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why reduce the number of projects in** the **Community and Pro tiers?**
A: With our new VM isolation and increased computing power per project, we're focusing on giving developers more resources for meaningful applications rather than many smaller projects.

**Q: How does usage-based pricing work?**
A: Your subscription includes base allocations, with transparent per-use pricing for additional resources like compute, storage, and bandwidth.

**Q: What happens to my existing projects?**
A: All existing projects will continue running without interruption during the 30-day transition period, giving you time to adjust to the new resource allocations.
