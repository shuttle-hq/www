We spent years building Shuttle for Rust, we listened to the community and the response was incredible. Developers love it because it solves a fundamental problem: the massive gap between writing code and deploying it.

Shuttle's success comes from Infrastructure-from-Code (IfC). Instead of juggling multiple config languages, you write Rust macros that control your infrastructure directly. This lets developers focus on their application logic without the need for a complicated deployment setup.

Over the years, we took advantage of the simplicity of the same pattern for other resources as well. Database provisioning demonstrates this well - in our current platform, developers can add one annotation and have a database ready regardless of the environment they are in and Shuttle will handle each environment specifically: If it's development, it will create a docker container with a Postgres instance and connect it to your code and if it's production, it will either create a dedicated AWS RDS instance or a shared DB based on the annotation.

Everything connects with full type safety without the need to define separate configuration files. This is what makes Shuttle loved by the community.

After many iterations and fixing many issues, we were finally able to provide a seamless experience providing infrastructure to our users. That got us to thinking: _could we step outside of Rust and bring the same experience to other languages?_

**This project is our shot at bringing this same experience to Python.**

## Shuttle Cobra

Shuttle Cobra is our first step to explore this idea and bring IfC to Python and potentially other languages in the future.

**Shuttle Cobra** is a Python framework that makes it easy to deploy Python code to your own AWS infrastructure using Python **type hints** and **decorators**. Unlike our main Shuttle platform, Cobra deploys directly to your own AWS account - you own the infrastructure and pay the AWS costs.

**Shuttle Cobra** is experimental and a POC (proof of concept) at the moment, our main goal is to gather feedback from the community and monitor adoption.

## How Shuttle Cobra Works

Just like Shuttle for Rust, the main goal for **Shuttle Cobra** is also **Simplicity**, we've made it so simple that you can deploy a Python job to AWS just by adding a few lines of code and if you already have a **Python job**, you can just add the same annotations and you're good to go.

Here is an example of a Python job that reads from an S3 bucket and writes to a database:

```python
from typing import Annotated
import shuttle_runtime
import shuttle_task
from shuttle_common import Bucket, BucketOptions, AllowWrite, RdsPostgres, RdsPostgresOptions

@shuttle_task.cron(schedule="0 * * * ? *")
async def main(
    bucket: Annotated[
        Bucket,
        BucketOptions(
            bucket_name="grafana-exporter-1234abcd",
            policies=[
                AllowWrite(account_id="842910673255", role_name="SessionTrackerService")
            ]
        )
    ],
    db: Annotated[RdsPostgres, RdsPostgresOptions()],
):
    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    shuttle_runtime.main(main)
```

Then just run `shuttle deploy` and you're done. There is **no vendor lock-in** here, you're still using the same AWS libraries (`boto3`, `aioboto3`) that you'd use without **Shuttle Cobra**. The framework just handles the infrastructure setup and you will write code the same way you'd write without it.

## What Happens Under the Hood

When you use `Annotated[Bucket, BucketOptions(...)]`, you're telling **Shuttle Cobra** "I need an S3 bucket with these settings."

Here's what happens when you deploy:

1. The **Shuttle Cobra** CLI reads your type hints to see what AWS resources you need
2. It generates the CloudFormation templates for you
3. Provisions everything in your AWS account
4. Packages your code into a container and deploys it to ECS
5. Sets up the CRON schedule with EventBridge

Your dependencies get injected at runtime, so your code stays clean.

## Fair Warning

This is experimental. Right now it only handles CRON jobs, but we think the approach could work for web services, Lambda functions and other workloads too.

We built this to see if the IfC idea that works so well in Rust could work in other languages. Turns out it can.

## What's Next?

We'd love to hear what you think about **Shuttle Cobra**. Since this is an experimental approach, your feedback will shape where we take it next.

Try it out and let us know:

- Does the IfC pattern feel natural in Python?
- What other AWS resources would be useful?
- What types of workloads beyond CRON jobs would you want to deploy this way?
