					We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
					ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This
					is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no
					right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to
					your request to speed up our response.

				<h3 className='mb-2 text-2xl font-bold text-head'>Time limit to respond</h3>

				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us
					longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
					requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
