					10. Tracking technologies used in our emails
				</h2>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that
					we have sent you, how many times you have read it and whether you have clicked on any links in
					that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the
					emails we send to you more relevant to your interests and to understand if you have opened and
					read any important administrative emails we might send you.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Most popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external
					images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client – these generally
					give you the option of choosing whether emails will display &ldquo;remote images&rdquo;,
					&ldquo;remote content&rdquo; or &ldquo;images&rdquo; by default.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block
					pixels and other tracking technologies.
