						necessary for the purposes set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2, in accordance with our legal
						obligations and legitimate business interests.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be
					retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:
				</p>
				<ol className='mb-5 list-decimal space-y-4 pl-[25px] text-xl'>
					<li>
						<strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Where we are processing personal information based
						on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable
						period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental
						interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Consent:</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on your
						consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or
						otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or
						provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Contract:</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on contract,
						we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some
						additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents
						the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual
						relationship.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on a
						legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary
						to fulfill the legal obligation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Claim:</strong> We may need to apply a &quot;legal hold&quot; that retains
						information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim. In
						that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means
						the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and

				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that

				</p>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Most popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external
					images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client – these generally
					give you the option of choosing whether emails will display &ldquo;remote images&rdquo;,
					&ldquo;remote content&rdquo; or &ldquo;images&rdquo; by default.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-5 text-xl'>
					Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block
