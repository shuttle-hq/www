              01 What is Shuttle?
            </h1>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              For those who may not be familiar, Shuttle is a cutting-edge, Rust-native cloud development platform that streamlines the development of code and manages infrastructure directly from your code.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Our initial goal was simple: to provide the fastest possible backend development experience for the most beloved programming language out there - <Link href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-admired-and-desired" target="_blank" className='underline'>at least according to StackOverflow.</Link> We knew that the key to achieving this goal was to make getting started with Shuttle as fast and easy as possible, which is why we decided to focus on Infrastructure from Code.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              During our &quot;closed alpha&quot; phase, we experimented with a range of different
              approaches until we finally struck gold with the idea of using macros for resource
              provisioning. With this breakthrough, we were able to provide developers with
              everything they needed with just a single line of code.

              02 Why should I use it?
            </h1>
            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Navigating complex consoles and writing extensive YAML files for infrastructure configuration can be daunting, setting up and wiring all the infrastructure is a time-consuming and error-prone process. There is also a steep learning curve that can detract individuals and teams from focusing on core application logic. By utilizing Infrastructure from Code in a cloud development platform, we can address these challenges for the quickly growing community of Rust backend developers and teams.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Rust, known for its safety, concurrency, and performance, is an excellent choice for creating efficient and reliable applications. Incorporating annotations into the main function allows you to leverage code generation and resource provisioning, streamlining your workflow and minimizing manual infrastructure management.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              This approach offers several benefits for various use cases, such as rapid prototyping and easy scaling of applications. Using Shuttle, you are simplifying the integration of development and operations processes, promoting collaboration and reducing the potential for errors since you are getting compile time insurance that you are getting the right infrastructure.

            </h1>

            <h2 className='mb-4 text-[32px] text-[#D8D8D8]'>Console</h2>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Providing users with a variety of options to manage their projects and resources is essential. While the CLI has been powerful and easy-to-use, we learned that a certain portion of our users preferred a more visual and interactive approach
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              The console, designed with user experience at its core, offers a comprehensive and intuitive interface for managing projects, resources and configurations. It is supposed to complement the existing CLI, giving users the flexbility to choose the method that best suits their workflow and preferences.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>Don’t worry, the CLI isn’t going anywhere.</p>

            />

            <h2 className='mb-4 text-[32px] text-[#D8D8D8]'>Support for more resources</h2>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Continuous support for new resources is important for creating a flexible and dependable cloud development environment, especially in the ever-evolving Rust ecosystem. As part of this commitment, Shuttle now offers support for Turso and DynamoDB, expanding its capabilities.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              On top of that, we are introducing <i>community</i> examples. While we try to document as many frameworks/examples as possible, maintaining them can become difficult hence, with the help of our community, we are introducing examples that are curated, provided and maintained by our lovely community so that you can get up and running quickly.
            </p>

            <h2 className='mb-4 text-[32px] text-[#D8D8D8]'>Supercharging developer productivity with LLMs</h2>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              We’ve revealed  <Link href="https://shuttle.rs/ai" target="_blank" className='underline'>Shuttle AI</Link> recently and we want to make it a companion in your development endeavors. The goal is simple, supercharging development productivity by enabling you to get started faster than ever. Even faster than getting a ‘hello-world’ app up and running.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              All it takes to generate & deploy a project is a single prompt, eg. <code>shuttle-ai build &quot;a blog backend&quot;</code> and in case you need an additional feature, for example, simply run eg. <code>shuttle-ai add-feature &quot;comments&quot;</code>.
            </p>

            <h2 className='mb-4 text-[32px] text-[#D8D8D8]'>Stability</h2>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              As we transition from the alpha phase to the beta release of Shuttle, addressing stability issues has been our top priority. We understand that our users need a reliable and seamless experience, especially when it comes to supporting production-level applications. Throughout the alpha phase, we listened to user feedback and identified areas that needed improvement, including fixing papercuts and enhancing overall performance.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              With the beta release, we are proud to deliver the progress we&apos;ve made in ensuring a stable and dependable platform. Our team has worked tirelessly to address previous concerns and implement solutions that provide a solid foundation for developers. As we continue to evolve and refine Shuttle, we remain committed to maintaining and improving stability.
            </p>

            <h2 className='mb-4 text-[32px] text-[#D8D8D8]'>Reliability</h2>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              Reliability is a cornerstone of any cloud development platform, as it ensures that users can depend on the platform&apos;s performance and trust its ability to support their applications.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-[30px]'>
              In response to valuable user feedback, we’ve significantly improved the platform&apos;s reliability. To further strengthen this commitment and maintain transparency, we are excited to announce the release of a dedicated status page. This status page will provide real-time updates on the Shuttle&apos;s performance, uptime, and any ongoing maintenance or issues, allowing users to stay informed and make informed decisions about their development processes.
            </p>
