					In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this
					Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except

					any circumstances beyond such Party&apos;s reasonable control, including but not limited to
					acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil
					unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of

					The date on which the Agreement was last modified will be updated at the top of this Agreement.
					Shuttle will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to any amendments or modifications
					taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Customer&apos;s account on
					the Services or by another method reasonably designed to provide notice to Customer. If
					Customer accesses or uses the Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement, such

					of the date of execution of such Order.

					that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the
					greatest extent possible.

				</h2>
				<p className='mb-10 text-xl'>
					This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State
					of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that
					would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
					State of California. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this
					Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder must be instituted in the federal courts of the
					United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in San Francisco

					Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each
					case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
					written consent of Shuttle. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section
					will be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating
					Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the
					benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

					directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the underlying software
					or technology to, or make the Services or the underlying software or technology accessible
					from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law,
					rule, or regulation. Customer shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and
					rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license
					or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise
					making the Services or the underlying software or technology available outside the US.

					&quot;commercial item&quot; as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Â§ 2.101, consisting of
					&quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software
					documentation&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Â§ 12.212. Accordingly, if Customer is

					with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in

				</p>

				<h2 className='mb-10 text-2xl font-bold text-[#C2C2C2]'>11. Equitable Relief</h2>
				<p className='mb-10 text-xl'>
					Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of
					its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2.3, would cause the other
					Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees
					that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to
					equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any
					other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or
					other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.
					Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available
					at law, in equity or otherwise.

					the sole and exclusive benefit of Customer). Otherwise, neither Party may use the name, logo,
					or other trademarks of the other Party for any purpose without the other Party&apos;s prior
					written approval.
